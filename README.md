# Textract
These are the stuff I worked on during my DSTA Internship in 2020! I managed to make Textract run out of my home computer, and perform stuff like table extraction on handwritten receipts. I wanted to build a Flask app to integrate Textract into a front-end app, but I kinda ran out of time since my internship was only for a month. Welp :( Still had a lot of fun tho. 

By the way, sample input invoices and outputs are provided in this repository.
